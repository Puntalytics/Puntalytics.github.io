# The Punt Runts Official 2022 season preview

### All-Pro Picks

**Raphael**
* 1st team: Blake Gillikin
* 2nd team: Michael Dickson

*Gillikin fits the mold of a second-year starter who showed elite flashes in his first year. He’s also really good at punting, hit an 80+ yard touchback in the preseason, and generally embodies the high-risk, high-reward attitude I like from punters. Michael Dickson is going to punt so much, he might be the defensive MVP of his team.*

**Dennis**
* 1st team: Riley Dixon or some other first-time winner
* 2nd team: Jake Bailey

*Let’s overreact to the first game of the season!*
*1. Dixon punted four times and all were solid, including a fair catch inside the 10 and another at the 11.*
*2. It also seems entirely possible that the Rams pass protection falls apart, and Dixon gets way more use than anyone bargained for!*
*Jake Bailey is really good at punting. He won’t be flashy, but he’ll quietly be so good that the voters have no choice but to reward him.*

**Jack**
* 1st team: Jake Bailey
* 2nd team: Thomas Morstead

*Jake Bailey is my boy, we share the same name, oh and he's not so quietly had the best punter season of all time, what else can I say. Had TMor punted the full season last year he might have gotten a pro-bowl nod.*

**Ian**
* 1st team: Ryan Stonehouse
* 2nd team: Ryan Stonehouse

*I agree with Raphael’s picks so I just want to say Stonehouse will be a revelation and take the league by storm.* 

### Most Improved Punter:

**Raphael**
* Arryn Siposs

*This take is 100% based on his final pre-season game, in which Siposs finally showed off some big-boot potential. He was so good at pinning teams deep, and so bad in the open field last year that we should expect regression to the mean in both categories. Open-field punting is both more important and happens more often than pin-deep punting, so a similar regression in both buckets would lead to an overall improvement. TLDR, it’s inevitable because…math?*

**Dennis**
* Matt Haack

*C’mon, this is easy money. If we’re calculated “most improved” as this year’s pEPA - last year’s pEPA, which I have decided that we are, this is practically a sure thing. Haack was a solid punter in Miami and had a very down year in Buffalo. Now he returns to the comfort of a dome in Indy. I predict he finishes with pEPA between -0.05 and 0.05.*

**Ian**
* Braden Mann

*Breakout year. Need I say more?*

**Jack**

* Jack Fox

*I didn't want this to be a list of punters who were bad in 2021, so I'm going with Jack Fox who was only slightly above average last year. He'll be way above average this year. Also we share the same name... I'm sensing a trend.*



### Bold Predictions:

**Raphael**
* Blake Gillikin finishes with a pEPA above .2

*Yes he’ll be first-team all-pro, but he’ll also be one of only 4 punters to accomplish this feat since 2015, joining Johnny Hekker (2016), and Jack Fox, Michael Dickson, and Jake Bailey (2020).*

**Dennis**
* Blake Gillikin finishes with a pEPA below .2

*Look I like Blake, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say that Raphael is being overly high on him because he’s on his punter fantasy team. I think he finishes top half, maybe even top 10, in pEPA.*

**Jack**
* Jake Bailey gets a ring

*feels like the patriots haven't won in a while, save the date.*


**Ian**
* Ryan Stonehouse is the best punter in the AFC by EPA.*

*no comment*

### Narratives we’ll be tweeting about by November:

**Raphael**
* Jake Bailey is BACK

*In 2020, Bailey smashed records, putting up a pEPA of over 0.3. He bounced back after a rocky start in 2021, and finished in the top 10 despite having to punt in a literal blizzard. Before the weather turns in Foxborough, all memories of the down-year-that-really-wasn’t-one will be gone.*

**Dennis**
* Brett Kern is BACK

*“Brett Kern is this year’s Thomas Morstead” is an easy take. All it takes is any punter to go on IR, and Kern’s phone will start ringing. He didn’t want to relocate his family to Buffalo - fair, I don’t want to do that either. But a four week vacation to show the league he’s still got it? I think there’s a good change that this happens, and that he’s very impressive. Maybe even impressive enough to find himself a starting gig somewhere next season.*

**Jack**
* Punting is BACK

*I mean have you seen the ~~Texans~~ ~~Seahawks~~ bears roster? ~~Cam Johnston~~ ~~Michael Dickson~~ Trent Gill might punt 150 times.*

**Ian** 
* The babies got BACK

*This will be the best class of punters in NFL history, and it’ll be a tight race for best rookie punter between Ryan Stonehouse and Jordan Stout. Teams will be kicking themselves (so to speak) for not drafting one of these blue chip soon to be punting legends.* 


## Game we’re most excited for

**Raphael**
* Week 12: Jaguars @ Lions, December 4

*Is Logan Cooke underrated? Does Jack Fox deserve a top of the market deal? Yes and yes. Congrats on making it this far in a preview about punters only.*

**Dennis**
* Week 5: Lions @ Pats, October 9

*Picking this game because I’m hoping to go to it and see the twin phenoms of Jack and Jake in action irl*

**Ian** 

* Week 17: Jets @ Seahawks

*Braden. Mann. Breakout. Year. Two bad offenses, lots of punts between the Elite Michael Dickson and the Elite Joe Fla- I mean Braden Mann.*

**Jack**

* The Super Bowl?

*idk what you want from me at this point*
