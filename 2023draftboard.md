# Official 2022 Punt Runts Punter Big Board

Before we get into our rankings, let's get one thing straight: it's hard to tell which college punters will make good pros. This is true of every position, of course, but we often forget that guys like Johnny Townsend and JK Scott were drafted whereas prospects like Jack Fox and Ryan Stonehouse were not. 

Here at Puntalytics we subscribe to a "kick ball far good" ideology. We value punters who above anything else can punt the ball far, really really far. We're sort of renegades among the puntalygensia for that. Now let's get to those rankings!

| Rank | Punter | School |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | [Bryce Baringer](#bryce-baringer)| Michigan State
| 2 | [Michael Turk](#michael-turk)| Oklahoma
| 3 | [Adam Korsak](#adam-korsak)| Rutgers
| 4 | [Ty Zentner](#ty-zentner)| Kansas State
| 5 | [Paxton Brooks](#paxton-brooks)| Tennessee
| 6 | [Lou Hedley](#lou-hedley)| Miami

## 1. Bryce Baringer (Michigan State) {#bryce-baringer}
HT: 6017  WT: 220  age: 23 
  
**2022: Punts: 51, net: 47.1,  pEPA: 0.38, OF: 0.58, PD: -0.25**  
**2021: Punts: 61, net: 45.9, pEPA: 0.30, OF: 0.43, PD: -0.01**
**2020: Punts: 36, net: 41.9, pEPA: -0.02, OF: 0.11, PD: -0.33**
**2018: Punts: 15, net: 45.9, pEPA: -0.49, OF: -0.77, PD: -0.17**

3-year starter at MSU, Baringer headlines the 2023 class. After spending his first years of eligibility figuring out how to be a consistent punter, he put it all together in his last two seasons at Michigan State. His Open-field vs Pin-deep differential is the largest we have on record, but the alarming -0.25 PD score might be more a product of sample size and touchback luck. With good coaching he should quickly become a plus starter.
**Bottom line:** Baringer perfectly fits the model of a modern NFL punter. Massive leg and the rest can be figured out **NFL Comp: Ryan Stonehouse**

## 2. Michael Turk (Oklahoma) {#michael-turk}
HT: 6002  WT: 227  age: 25 
  
**2022: Punts: 67, net: 46.3, pEPA: 0.19, OF: 0.30, PD: -0.02**  
**2021: Punts: 35, net: 48.5, pEPA: 0.44, OF: 0.55, PD: 0.15**
**2020: Punts: 14, net: 44.4, pEPA: 0.02, OF: -0.03, PD: 0.05**
**2019: Punts: 67, net: 43.9, pEPA: 0.31, OF: 0.49, PD: 0.17**

Turk showed elite potential in limited action in 2021, before coming back down to earth in his final year at OU. He boasts a powerful leg with more control than Baringer. He declared for the 2022 draft but was not selected or signed. This may be a red flag for teams, but we believe he has what it takes to make a solid pro.
**Bottom line:** More refined punter than Baringer with a lower ceiling. May have played his draft cards wrong. **NFL Comp: JK Scott**  

## 3. Adam Korsak (Rutgers) {#adam-korsak}
HT: 6005  WT: 191  age: 25 
  
**2022: Punts: 68, net: 44.3, pEPA: 0.24, OF: 0.22, PD: 0.28**  
**2021: Punts: 72, net: 45.8, pEPA: 0.21, OF: 0.21, PD: 0.21**
**2020: Punts: 48, net: 42.9, pEPA: 0.19, OF: 0.19, PD: 0.21**
**2019: Punts: 76, net: 43.3, pEPA: 0.15, OF: 0.06, PD: 0.33**
**2018: Punts: 78, net: 41.9, pEPA: 0.03, OF: 0.04, PD: 0.02**

2022 Ray Guy Award winner Adam Korsak put together an impressive body of work in his 5 years at Rutgers. He boasts impressive pin-deep numbers and solid but unflashy open-field numbers. In a changing NFL punting landscape, Korsak may be a dying breed, but plenty of college punters have figured out how to boom punts only after they leave college (see Jack Fox).
**Bottom line:** Remarkably consistent punter who may not have the elite leg to impress at the NFL level **NFL Comp: Arryn Siposs** 

## 4. Ty Zentner (Kansas State) {#ty-zentner}
HT: 6015  WT: 199  age: 24 
  
**2022: Punts: 65, net: 42.5, pEPA: 0.15, OF: 0.18, PD: 0.09**  
**2021: Punts: 43, net: 42.1, pEPA: 0.12, OF: 0.29, PD: -0.06**
**2020: Punts: 28, net: 40.21, pEPA: -0.01, OF: -0.05, PD: 0.06**

**Bottom line:** Highlight reel punter with a knack for shanks (Four 60+ yarders downed inside the 5, to go with 8 shanks in 2022) **NFL Comp: Jake Bailey but only the highest highs and the lowest lows** 

## 5. Paxton Brooks (Tennesee) {#paxton-brooks}
HT: 6054  WT: 199  age: 23 
  
**2022: Punts: 40, net: 39.3, pEPA: -0.11, OF: -0.14, PD: -0.06**  
**2021: Punts: 45, net: 43.6, pEPA: 0.15, OF: 0.07, PD: 0.29**
**2020: Punts: 49, net: 43.5, pEPA: 0.14, OF: 0.26, PD: -0.11**
**2019: Punts: 29, net: 41.0, pEPA: -0.02, OF: 0.03, PD: -0.11**

**Bottom line:** Inconsistent punter who has shown enough flashes to get him to someone's spring workouts **NFL Comp: J. Schroeder but who could turn into Blake Gillikin** 

## 5. Lou Hedley (Miami) {#lou-hedley}
HT: 6027  WT: 222  age: 29 
  
**2022: Punts: 49, net: 44.1, pEPA: 0.22, OF: 0.27, PD: 0.12**  
**2021: Punts: 45, net: 43.3, pEPA: 0.17, OF: 0.16, PD: 0.18**
**2020: Punts: 49, net: 46.6, pEPA: 0.14, OF: 0.47, PD: 0.29**
**2019: Punts: 29, net: 41.8, pEPA: 0.08, OF: 0.07, PD: 0.11**

**Bottom line:** 29 year-old Aussie with elite college production, who is probably too old to be considered by NFL teams. **NFL Comp: Max Duffy**
