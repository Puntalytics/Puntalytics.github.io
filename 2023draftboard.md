## 1. Bryce Baringer (Michigan State) class {#bryce-baringer}
HT: 6017  WT: 220  age: ? 
  
**2022: Punts: 51, net: 47.1,  pEPA: 0.38, OF: 0.58, PD: -0.25**  
**2021: Punts: 61, net: 45.9, pEPA: 0.30, OF: 0.43, PD: -0.01**
**2020: Punts: 36, net: 41.9, pEPA: -0.02, OF: 0.11, PD: -0.33**
**2018: Punts: 15, net: 45.9, pEPA: -0.49, OF: -0.77, PD: -0.17**

3-year starter at MSU, Baringer headlines the 2023 class. After spending his first years of eligibility figuring out how to be a consistent punter, he put it all together in his last two seasons at Michigan State. His Open-field vs Pin-deep differential is the largest we have on record, but the alarming -0.25 PD score might be more a product of sample size and touchback luck. With good coaching he should quickly become a plus starter.
**Bottom line:** Baringer perfectly fits the model of a modern NFL punter. Massive leg and the rest can be figured out **NFL Comp: Ryan Stonehouse**

## 2. Michael Turk (Oklahoma) class {#michael-turk}
HT: 6002  WT: 227  age: ? 
  
**2022: Punts: 67, net: 46.3, pEPA: 0.19, OF: 0.30, PD: -0.02**  
**2021: Punts: 35, net: 48.5, pEPA: 0.44, OF: 0.55, PD: 0.15**
**2020: Punts: 14, net: 44.4, pEPA: 0.02, OF: -0.03, PD: 0.05**
**2019: Punts: 67, net: 43.9, pEPA: 0.31, OF: 0.49, PD: 0.17**

Turk showed elite potential in limited action in 2021, before coming back down to earth in his final year at OU. He boasts a powerful leg with more control than Baringer. He declared for the 2022 draft but was not selected or signed. This may be a red flag for teams, but we believe he has what it takes to make a solid pro.
**Bottom line:** More refined punter than Baringer with a lower ceiling. May have played his draft cards wrong. **NFL Comp: JK Scott**  

## 3. Adam Korsak (Rutgers) class {#adam-korsak}
HT: 6005  WT: 191  age: ? 
  
**2022: Punts: 68, net: 44.3, pEPA: 0.24, OF: 0.22, PD: 0.28**  
**2021: Punts: 72, net: 45.8, pEPA: 0.21, OF: 0.21, PD: 0.21**
**2020: Punts: 48, net: 42.9, pEPA: 0.19, OF: 0.19, PD: 0.21**
**2019: Punts: 76, net: 43.3, pEPA: 0.15, OF: 0.06, PD: 0.33**
**2018: Punts: 78, net: 41.9, pEPA: 0.03, OF: 0.04, PD: 0.02**

2022 Ray Guy Award winner Adam Korsak put together an impressive body of work in his 5 years at Rutgers. He boasts impressive pin-deep numbers and solid but unflashy open-field numbers. In a changing NFL punting landscape, Korsak may be a dying breed, but plenty of college punters have figured out how to boom punts only after they leave college (see Jack Fox).
**Bottom line:** Remarkably consistent punter who may not have the elite leg to impress at the NFL level **NFL Comp: Arryn Siposs**
