Welcome to the Puntalytics website! Puntalytics, aka the Punt Runts, is a group of avid amateur sports data analysts committed to uncovering deep truths about punting. This site contains examples of our work, as well as the documentation for our R package, [`puntr`](https://puntalytics.github.io/puntr/)
  
If you somehow made it here without knowing about [our twitter](https://twitter.com/ThePuntRunts), be sure to check that out; most of our content lives over there.
