# puntr, an R package for puntalytics

We've been compiling our code for importing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing punting data into an R package, `puntr`. 
This is mostly for our own ease of use, but it's also available on github for anyone interested.  
  
Install via:
```R
devtools::install_github("Puntalytics/puntr")
library(puntr)
```

You can find a .rds files of all punts from each season 1999-2019 [here](https://github.com/Puntalytics/puntr/tree/master/data)
