# Ceiling to Floor Comparisons

Instead of giving you standard one-to-one NFL comparisons, we give you a range of percentile outcomes for each of our top-5 punters. Then, each of the four of us give you our best guess for where (between 0 and 100) each prospect's career will end up. Whoever had the a-spiciest take on each punter will attempt to justify their prediction.

The San Diego State prospect is the biggest wild-card of our top punters, and so he has the widest range of potential outcomes. His range starts all the way up at the tippy top with the GOAT himself, Shane Lechler. [Read more](https://puntalytics.github.io/draft_central/bigboard.html#matt-araiza)
