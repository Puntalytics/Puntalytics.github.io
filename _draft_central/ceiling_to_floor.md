# Ceiling to Floor Comparisons

Instead of giving you standard one-to-one NFL comparisons, we give you a range of percentile outcomes for each of our top-5 punters.[^1] Then, each of the four of us give you our best guess for where (between 0 and 100) each prospect's career will end up. Whoever had the a-spiciest take on each punter will attempt to justify their prediction.

## Matt Araiza 

The San Diego State prospect is the biggest wild-card of our top punters, and so he has the widest range of potential outcomes. His range starts all the way up at the tippy top with the GOAT himself, Shane Lechler. [Read more](https://puntalytics.github.io/draft_central/bigboard.html#matt-araiza)

- Ceiling: Shane Lechler
- 80: Todd Sauerbrun
- 60: Bryan Anger       
- 40: Corey Bojorquez   
- 20: Bradley Pinion
- Floor: Johnny Townsend

**Punt Runts predictions:**
- Jack: 85
- Ian: 62 if Ravens or Chargers, 43 if a cowardly team
- Raphael: 56
- Dennis: 45

*"When you watch Araiza, you think some 12 year old kid thought it was funny to have a create-a-player in madden who was a punter. They maxed out all the stats, but at the end of the day, the kid is still 12. Gotta see if the skill gap transfers to playing with adults."*

## Jordan Stout

Most punting experts agree that Jordan Stout is the most pro-ready prospect. We certainly don't disagree, as we all gave him scores above 50. Plenty of elite college punters have faltered in the pros though, so nothing is a given. [Read more](https://puntalytics.github.io/draft_central/bigboard.html#jordan-stout)

- Ceiling: Johnny Hekker
- 80: Brett Kern
- 60: Mitch Wishnowsky
- 40: Riley Dixon
- 20: JK Scott
- Floor: Coby Wadman

**Punt Runts predictions:**
- Dennis: 75
- Raphael: 65
- Ian: 61
- Jack: 55

*"The year is 2026, Jordan Stout signs a 5 year extension making him the highest paid punter in NFL history. Somewhere on draft twitter, people still argue that the Chargers drafted him too high."*

## Race Porter: 

Race Porter is our dark horse candidate in this year's class. Some of us are high on him, and some of us are...not [Read more](https://puntalytics.github.io/draft_central/bigboard.html#race-porter)

- Ceiling: Brett Kern
- 80: Brian Moorman
- 60: Michael Palardy
- 40: Joseph Charlton
- 20: Sterling Hofrichter
- Floor: Chas Henry

**Punt Runts predictions:**
- Dennis: 72
- Jack: 67
- Raphael: 62
- Ian: 22
  
*"I believe in pEPA, so I believe in Race Porter. I haven't watched the tape, but that's ok, because he looks amazing on a spreadsheet and I made that spreadsheet."*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Dennis

## Jake Camarda

We called him the most consistent punter in this year's class, and it turns out every other credible punt analyst (puntalyst?) did too. Maybe we're all on to something. Maybe people just actually watched Georgia and secretly everyone loves watching punters. [Read more](https://puntalytics.github.io/draft_central/bigboard.html#jake-camarda)

- Ceiling: Tress Way
- 80: Kevin Huber
- 60: Pat O‚ÄôDonnell
- 40: Chris Jones
- 20: Nick Harris
- Floor: Jamie Gillan

**Punt Runts predictions:**
- Dennis: 61
- Raphael: 48
- Jack: 40
- Ian: 35

*"Camarda is the Stetson Bennet of punting. Clearly he got the job done but when people ask ‚Äúis this guy going to the NFL?‚Äù you just don‚Äôt get as hyped as you thought you would "*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Ian

## Ryan Stonehouse

Stonehouse has the highest sample size of any punter in this years class. His highs are impressive, yet he's always been overshadowed by someone just a little bit better than him. [Read more](https://puntalytics.github.io/draft_central/bigboard.html#ryan-stonehouse)

- Ceiling: Cameron Johnston
- 80: Ryan Allen
- 60: Drew Kaser
- 40: Johnny Townsend
- 20: James Smith
- Floor: Drew Riggleman

**Punt Runts predictions:**
- Jack: 70
- Ian: 62
- Dennis: 50
- Raphael: 44

*"If Araiza weren‚Äôt in this class, we‚Äôd be talking about Stonehouse as the next üÖ±Ô∏èig üÖ±Ô∏èoot guy"*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Ian
