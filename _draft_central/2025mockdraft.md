# Punters-only mock draft 1.0
The date is April 26th, 2025. You've just awoken from a peaceful two-day slumber during which nothing of consequence happened. You settle in front of the television to excitedly watch teams make the most important, franchise-shaping roster decisions of the calendar year. It's day 3 of the draft baby! Here is what you can expect to see:

## Round 4:

This punter class isn't good enough to warrant a 4th-round selection. But it does happen! Mitch Wishnowsky, Jordan Stout, Jake Camarda, and Tory Taylor are recent examples

## Round 5:

I also have a hard time seeing a punter being drafted here. According to our metrics, Eddie Czaplicki warrants it, but I don't think teams around the league see it the same way.

## Round 6:

#### With the 197th pick, the Broncos **Eddie Czaplicki** punter, USC!

The Broncos are the only team in the league, who must exit the draft with a punter. They are currently rostering Matt Haack, a formerly serviceable, now replacement level leg. Haack hasn't been a full time player since 2022, and hasn't been above average since 2020. In Czaplicki, the Broncos find a big leg with big time upside. The Ray Guy winner has only had one season of elite production, but he was so good in 2024, that teams should be tantalized by his potential.

#### With the 206th pick, the Bills select **Jeremy Crawshaw** punter, Florida!

With the run on punter started, the Bills are happy to nab the draft's most consistent punter in Crawshaw. The Bills are relieved that they won't have to watch the training camp punter battle between Jake Camarda and Brad Robbins. With draft capital invested in him, Crawshaw will now be favored to beat out Camarda. In Crawshaw, the Bills get a punter with two years of top tier production over a span of four good college seasons. It's rare to see college punters produce as many above average seasons as Crawshaw, and the Bills happily draft the highest floor punter prospect.

## Round 7:

#### With the 230th pick, the Panthers select **Alex Mastromanno** punter, FSU!

This is not the kind of draft class that sees 3 punters drafted, but we can still dream. The Panthers signed Sam Martin to a one-year, fully-guaranteed contract in March, why would they draft a punter? They probably won't... Sam Martin is still serviceable (he's been an above average punter in 8 of his 11 years), but he's not getting any younger, and the Panthers currently hold 6 day-three picks. They take the punter we have affectionately dubbed "The Maestro," the only other punter in this class who clears our draftable thresholds. He'll probably sit on the practice squad for a year before becomming the starter in 2026.
