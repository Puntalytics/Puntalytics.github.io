# Official 2025 Puntalytics Punter Draft Board

Before we get into our rankings, let's get one thing straight: it's hard to tell which college punters will make good pros. This is true of every position, of course, but we often forget that guys like Johnny Townsend and JK Scott were drafted whereas prospects like Jack Fox and Ryan Stonehouse were not. 

Here at Puntalytics we subscribe to a "kick ball far good" ideology. We value punters who above anything else can punt the ball far, really really far. We're sort of renegades among the puntalygensia for that. Now let's get to those rankings!

| Rank | Punter | School |
|--|--|--|
| 1 | [Eddie Czaplicki](#eddie-czaplicki)| USC
| 2 | [Jeremy Crawshaw](#jeremy-crawshaw)| Florida
| 3 | [Alex Mastromanno](#alex-mastromanno)| FSU 
| 4 | [James Burnip](#james-burnip)| Alabama
| 5 | [Fraser Masin](#Fraser-Masin)| Ole Miss
| 6 | [Kai Kroeger](#Kai-Kroeger)| South Carolina
| 7 | [Jesse Mirco](#jesse-mirco)| Vanderbilt

Read on for our takes and custom metrics on all your favorite punting prospects. Be sure to keep checking back at [our twitter feed](https://twitter.com/ThePuntRunts) for the latest draft content! Adj Net is return adjusted net, OF is Open-field score (inside own 40), and PD is pin-deep score (beyond own 40). Curious about our custom EPA metric, pEPA? Read about it and our other metrics [here](/metrics.html).
  
## 1. Eddie Czaplicki (USC) {#eddie-czaplicki}
HT: 6'0"  WT: 200  age: 22 
  
**2024: Punts: 43, adj net: 44.2, pEPA: 0.38, OF: 0.44, PD: 0.26**   
**2023: Punts: 44, adj net: 41.1, pEPA: 0.09, OF: 0.17, PD: -0.03**  
**2022: Punts: 44, adj net: 40.5, pEPA: 0.06, OF: 0.04, PD: 0.09**  
**2021: Punts: 47, adj net: 39.3, pEPA: 0.07, OF: 0.07, PD: 0.06** 

You don't usually see a 22 year old, Ray Guy Winner, as a dark horse to be drafted first, but that's exactly what Czaplicki is this year. Out of all the draft eligible punters in 2025, he has by far the best single season (0.38 pEPA in 2024). And yet, no one seems to be talking about him. Czaplicki has the age profile and the big leg that we look for in draftable punters. If it were up to us, we'd draft him in the 5th round, but given the weakness of the punter class and the lack of teams who need a punter, **expect him to go in the 7th**

## 2. Jeremy Crawshaw (Florida) {#jeremy-crawshaw}
HT: 6'3"  WT: 201  age: 23 
  
**2024: Punts: 59, adj net: 41.8, pEPA: 0.16, OF: 0.20, PD: 0.08**   
**2023: Punts: 42, adj net: 44.3, pEPA: 0.27, OF: 0.34, PD: 0.08**  
**2022: Punts: 38, adj net: 44.0, pEPA: 0.24, OF: 0.23, PD: 0.29**  
**2021: Punts: 52, adj net: 40.1, pEPA: 0.11, OF: 0.34, PD: -0.21** 

Crawshaw is this year's media darling. He is Dane Brugler's #1 ranked punter and Lance Zierlein's #2. With solid seasons in 2022 and 2023, he meets our draftable thresholds for punter. He has always been better in the open field than in pin deep situations, which projects better to the pros. It's hard not to wonder about his dropoff in 2024. We prefer punters who leave college on a high note. **Crawshaw projects as a 7th round pick and might need a year of development before becoming a starter**

## 3. Alex Mastromanno (FSU) {#alex-mastromanno}
HT: 6'1"  WT: 243   
  
**2024: Punts: 59, adj net: 44.2, pEPA: 0.27, OF: 0.27, PD: 0.26**   
**2023: Punts: 67, adj net: 42.6, pEPA: 0.11, OF: 0.11, PD: 0.27**  
**2022: Punts: 38, adj net: 38.5, pEPA: 0.06, OF: -0.04, PD: 0.22**  
**2021: Punts: 62, adj net: 41.0, pEPA: 0.08, OF: 0.0, PD: 0.36**  
**2020: Punts: 35, adj net: 40.1, pEPA: -0.01, OF: -0.03, PD: 0.06** 

It would be great if Mastromanno could become a top tier punter because we'd be able to call him "the maestro," which feels like a terrific nickname for a punter. He's this class's pin deep specialist, which doesn't often work out (see Adam Korsak or Blake Hayes). We couldn't find his age, but if he is under 25, he meets our draftable thresholds. **He is worthy a draft selection in the 7th**

## 4. James Burnip (Alabama) {#james-burnip}
HT: 6'6"  WT: 235  age: 24 
  
**2024: Punts: 51, adj net: 42.3, pEPA: 0.17, OF: 0.27, PD: -0.08**   
**2023: Punts: 57, adj net: 43.1, pEPA: 0.22, OF: 0.45, PD: -0.26**  
**2022: Punts: 46, adj net: 38.8, pEPA: -0.01, OF: 0.08, PD: -0.11**  
**2021: Punts: 48, adj net: 37.5, pEPA: -0.11, OF: -0.22, PD: 0.05** 

James Burnip has this class's highest single season Open Field split, which we love. He doesn't have a season above 0.25 pEPA, which we don't. When drafting punters, though, teams should absolutely bet on upside, and Burnip might have the highest ceiling in the class. **We see him as a priority free agent add, but he could very well get drafted**

## 5. Fraser Masin (Ole Miss) {#fraser-masin}
Age: 23
  
**2024: Punts: 35, adj net: 43.1, pEPA: 0.23, OF: 0.37, PD: 0.06**   
**2023: Punts: 47, adj net: 40.5, pEPA: -0.02, OF: -0.01, PD: -0.05**  
**2022: Punts: 41, adj net: 39.2, pEPA: -0.04, OF: -0.07, PD: 0.01** 

Fraser Masin is kind of a poor man's James Burnip. He's on neither Dane Brugler nor Lance Zierlein's big boards, but he was at the combine. He profiles similarly to Burnip (big, not-quite-accurate-yet leg), but has had a good bit fewer reps. **He would be a great UDFA add for a team looking to develop a punter in the wings**

## 6. Kai Kroeger (South Carolina) {#kai-kroeger}
HT: 6'3"  WT: 213 Age: 22   
  
**2024: Punts: 39, adj net: 42.0, pEPA: 0.17, OF: 0.28, PD: -0.03**   
**2023: Punts: 60, adj net: 42.8, pEPA: 0.08, OF: 0.01, PD: 0.20**  
**2022: Punts: 61, adj net: 44.4, pEPA: 0.15, OF: 0.22, PD: 0.07**  
**2021: Punts: 60, adj net: 40.4, pEPA: 0.15, OF: 0.18, PD: 0.11**  
**2020: Punts: 38, adj net: 39.2, pEPA: -0.04, OF: -0.06, PD: 0.01** 

People love Kai Kroeger, and he certainly has impressive experience given his age, but it's hard to fall in love with that statistical profile. Who knows, though? He could always be this year's AJ Cole. **He should be a UDFA add, and will look to compete for a job in camp**

## 7. Jesse Mirco (Vanderbilt) {#jesse-mirco}
HT: 6'3"  WT: 220  age: 28 
  
**2024: Punts: 51, adj net: 42.3, pEPA: 0.20, OF: 0.27, PD: 0.1**   
**2023: Punts: 51, adj net: 41.7, pEPA: 0.16, OF: 0.18, PD: 0.12**  
**2022: Punts: 50, adj net: 43.9, pEPA: 0.12, OF: 0.02, PD: 0.23**  
**2021: Punts: 30, adj net: 41.4, pEPA: 0.18, OF: 0.12, PD: 0.26** 

Every class needs a token old Aussie. Teams seem less reluctant to start players like this than they used to (Tory Taylor and Lou Hedley are two recent examples), but it's hard not to be scared away by the age.
