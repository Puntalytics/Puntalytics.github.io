# Official 2025 Puntalytics Punter Draft Board

Before we get into our rankings, let's get one thing straight: it's hard to tell which college punters will make good pros. This is true of every position, of course, but we often forget that guys like Johnny Townsend and JK Scott were drafted whereas prospects like Jack Fox and Ryan Stonehouse were not. 

Here at Puntalytics we subscribe to a "kick ball far good" ideology. We value punters who above anything else can punt the ball far, really really far. We're sort of renegades among the puntalygensia for that. Now let's get to those rankings!
