# Top 2023 Punter Free Agents

### 1. Tommy Townsend

##### The Chiefs tendered Townsend at the lowest tender, he could still sign elsewhere

*2022 pEPA rank: 1st/35*

Townsend was, by any important metrics, the best NFL punter in 2022. His breakout season puts him in line for an eventual top of the market deal, even if his first two years in the league were near average. He is a restricted free agent, so that contract may not come this year, but **his RFA status makes him a virtual lock to be re-signed by the Chiefs.**

### 2. Blake Gillikin

*2022 pEPA rank: 8th/35*

###### Gillikin signed an extension with the Saints and will change his jersey number, per Blake himself

Gillikin redshirted behind Thomas Morstead in 2020, then broke out in 2021 with a season long .08 pEPA score, which he followed up with a .06 pEPA score in 2022. He hasn’t put together a season like Townsend’s 2022 yet, but he’s shown in individual games that he has the leg to put together elite performances. **As an ERFA, expect him to re-sign with the Saints.**

### 3. Thomas Morstead 

*2022 pEPA rank: 10th/35*

Gillikin’s former mentor has gone through quite the career renaissance after a down 2020, including a top 4 finish in 2021 despite punting for two teams, and the infamous butt punt in 2022. On name alone, Morstead deserves to be first on this list, but he is 37, which may give some teams pause. It would be surprising to see him leave Miami, and **the Dolphins have little reason to move on from him this season.**

### 4. Jake Bailey

*2022 pEPA rank: 33rd/35*

Bailey has had a WILD start to his career. He showed promise in his rookie season, finishing the year with a .06 pEPA (better than most of the guys below him career bests). Then he exploded in 2020, finishing with a first-team all-pro nod after arguably the greatest punter season of all time. He came back down to earth in 2021, finishing 9th in pEPA among all qualified punters (ahead of household names like Michael Dickson, Jack Fox, and Tommy Townsend). He signed a top of the market extension before the 2022 season, and almost immediately looked like a different punter. After 9 weeks as statistically the worst punter in the league, the Patriots placed him on IR. Towards the end of the season, Bailey was suspended by the team, which he contested, and on March 10th, he was cut. **Pending his medicals, he instantly becomes the top free agent on the market** (given that the three guys above him feel like they'll re-sign)

### 5. Sam Martin 

##### Martin reportedly agreed to a 3 year $7.5M extension with the Bills per Mike Garafolo

*2022 pEPA rank: 9th/35*

Martin was the hero Buffalo both needed and deserved. After a solid start to his career in Detroit, followed by a successful stint in Denver, Martin put together one of the best years of his career in one of the most difficult punter stadiums. The Bills have been on quite the punter rollercoaster since Corey Bojorquez’s breakout 2020, the failed Matt Haack signing, and the disastrous Araiza pick. **We expect both sides to reach a deal to keep Martin in Buffalo.**

### 6. Riley Dixon 

*2022 pEPA rank: 18th/35*

Riley Dixon had a fine and unflashy 2022 with the Rams. Sometimes that’s all you need. But if that’s all you’re going to get, why not try your luck in the UDFA pool? **This one's a tossup.**

### 7. Jamie Gillan 

##### Gillan reportedly agreed to a 2 year $4M deal worth up to $5M with the Giants, per Tom Pelissero

*2022 pEPA rank: 23/35*

Scottish Hammer, Jamie Gillan bounced back from a rough 2021 with a near-average 2022, and in the process gave us Michael Dickson’s double punt’s evil alter ego: [the oopsie whoopsie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUJTfB5UI0). **This one could go either way,** pending on how the Giants feel about special team gaffes.

### 8. Bradley Pinion

##### Pinion reportedly agreed to a 3 year $8.65M deal with $4.325M guaranteed with the Falcons, per tom Pelissero

*2022 pEPA rank: 19th/35*

Pinion signed a one year-prove it deal with the Falcons after a rough stint in Tampa Bay (though it depends who you’re asking) and delivered, posting a 0.02 pEPA, the best mark of his career (and the only time he’s ended a season above average). The Falcons have no entrenched succession plan at punter, so **Pinion is a safe option for Atlanta, but they may choose to go a cheaper route.**

### 9. Corliss Waitman 

##### The Broncos tendered ERFA Corliss Waitman per Doug Kyed

*2022 pEPA rank: 28th/35*

Waitman was a terrific fantasy punter, due to unreal volume (he can thank Russell Wilson for that), but didn’t quite break out in his first year as a starter. **He showed enough that the Broncos will feel fine about keeping him around at his low price tag.**

### 10. Jordan Berry 

*2022 pEPA rank: NA*

Jordan Berry has posted above average numbers in each of his seasons except 2021. Minnesota definitely made the right choice to keep UDFA Ryan Wright over him in 2022, but **he’s shown enough that he should still get a shot to start somewhere.**

### 11. JK Scott 

*2022 pEPA rank: 27th/35*

The JK Scott experiment worked better for the Chargers than the Ty Long experiment. Still though, the Chargers might be served by once again looking for an actual upgrade at punter. **Spoiler: they won’t.**

### 12. Matt Haack

*2022 pEPA rank: 30th/35*

Haack showed that his down 2021 was likely not a coincidence, as he could not get out of the bottom tier of punters, even in an indoor stadium. He’ll do fine in a pinch, but with Rigoberto Sanchez set to return to the Colts, **he’s likely slated to be the first punter to sign in case of a punter injury.** 

### 13. Kevin Huber 

*2022 pEPA rank: 32nd/35*

Huber was replaced mid-season by Drue Chrisman after a rough start to the year. If he wants to keep punting this season, he’d make sense as a camp leg and mentoring presence to whatever team decides to draft a punter. **As a lifelong Bengal and Cincinnati legend, he may not want to go elsewhere.**

### 14. Brett Kern 

*2022 pEPA rank: 35th/35*

The month of January was not kind to Kern. He did not look like himself in relief of Arryn Siposs. Then he was a healthy scratch in the Super Bowl, where he watched Siposs hit a sad line drive that definitely had an impact on the final score. It’s unclear whether he’ll hang ‘em up this off-season. **He still makes a terrific holder and showed many positive signs in the 2022 preseason before a multi month hiatus.**

### 15. Michael Palardy

*2022 pEPA rank: 34th/35*

The Patriots signed Palardy as an injury replacement for the struggling Jake Bailey, and it did not go well. Palardy has the NFL clout and left-leggedness to stick around the roster bubble for a little while longer. **He'll have to show a lot more** before we feel good about him getting playing time over the newest crop of punter prospects.

### Other names to watch out for:

Joseph Charlton, Jake Julien, Hunter Niswander, Cameron Nizialek, Dom Maggio, Seth Vernon, Race Porter, Ty Long, Dan Whelan, Marquette King, Mac Brown, Michael Carrizosa, Brad Wing, Sterling Hofrichter, José Borregales
