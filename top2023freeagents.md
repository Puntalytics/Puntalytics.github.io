# Top 13 2022 Punter Free Agents

1. Tommy Townsend
	Townsend was, by any important metrics, the best NFL punter in 2022. His breakout season puts him in line for an eventual top of the market deal, even if his first two years in the league were near average. He is a restricted free agent though, so that contract may not come this year, but **his RFA status makes him a virtual lock to be re-signed by the Chiefs.**

2. Blake Gillikin
	Gillikin redshirted behind Thomas Morstead in 2020, then broke out in 2021 with a season long .08 pEPA score, which he followed up with a .06 pEPA score in 2022. He hasn’t put together a season like Townsend’s 2022 yet, but he’s shown in individual games that he has the leg to put together elite performances. **As an ERFA, expect him to re-sign with the Saints.**

3. Thomas Morstead
	Gillikin’s former mentor has gone through quite the career renaissance after a down 2020, including a top 4 finish in 2021 despite punting for two teams, and the infamous butt punt in 2022. On name alone, Morstead deserves to be first on this list, but he is 37, which may give some teams pause. It would be surprising to see him leave Miami, and **the Dolphins have little reason to move on from him this season.**

4. Sam Martin
	Martin was the hero Buffalo both needed and deserved. After a solid start to his career in Detroit, followed by a successful stint in Denver, Martin put together one of the best years of his career in one of the most difficult punter stadiums. The Bills have been on quite the punter rollercoaster since Corey Bojorquez’s breakout 2020, the failed Matt Haack signing, and the disastrous Araiza pick. **We expect both sides to reach a deal to keep Martin in Buffalo.**


5. Bradley Pinion
	Pinion signed a one year-prove it deal with the Falcons after a rough stint in Tampa Bay (though it depends who you’re asking) and delivered, posting a 0.02 pEPA, the best mark of his career (and the only time he’s ended a season above average). The Falcons have no entrenched succession plan at punter, so **Pinion is a safe bet to re-sign.**

6. Jamie Gillan
	Scottish Hammer, Jamie Gillan bounced back from a rough 2021, with a near-average 2022, and in the process gave us Michael Dickson’s double punt’s evil alter ego: [the oopsie whoopsie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUJTfB5UI0). **This one could go either way,** pending on how the Giants feel about special team gaffes.

7. Riley Dixon
	Riley Dixon had a fine and unflashy 2022 with the Rams. Sometimes that’s all you need. But if that’s all you’re going to get, why not try your luck in the UDFA pool? **Also a tossup.**

8. Corliss Waitman
	Waitman was a terrific fantasy punter, due to unreal volume (he can thank Russell Wilson for that), but didn’t quite break out in his first year as a starter. **He showed enough that the Broncos will feel fine about keeping him around at his low price tag.**

9. Jordan Berry
	Jordan Berry has posted above average numbers in each of his seasons except 2021. Minnesota definitely made the right choice to keep UDFA Ryan Wright over him in 2022, but **he’s shown enough that he should still get a shot to start somewhere.**

10. JK Scott
	The JK Scott experiment worked better for the Chargers than the Ty Long experiment. Still though, the Chargers might be served by once again looking for an actual upgrade at punter. **Spoiler: they won’t.**

11. Matt Haack
	Haack showed that his down 2021 was not a coincidence, as he could not get out of the bottom tier of punters, even in an indoor stadium. He’ll do fine in a pinch, but with Rigoberto Sanchez set to return to the Colts, **he’s likely slated to be the first punter to sign in case of a punter injury.** 

12. Kevin Huber
Huber was replaced mid-season by Drue Chrisman after a rough start to the year. If he wants to keep punting this season, he’d make sense as a camp leg and mentoring presence to whatever team decides to draft a punter. **As a lifelong Bengal and Cincinnati legend, he may not want to go elsewhere.**

13. Brett Kern
	The month of January was not kind to Brett Kern. He did not look like himself in relief of Arryn Siposs. Then he was a healthy scratch in the Super Bowl, where he watched Siposs hit a sad line drive that definitely had an impact on the final score. It’s unclear whether he’ll hang ‘em up this off-season. **He still makes a terrific holder and showed many positive signs in the 2022 preseason before a multi month hiatus.**
