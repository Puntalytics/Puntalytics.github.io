**So you want to add punters to your fantasy league but have no idea
where to start?**

Don’t you worry, because you’ve arrived at the

# Punt Runts Fantasy Punting Football Guide

## Section 1: The Official Unofficial Punt Runts Approved Fantasy Punting Scoring System

Our scoring system rewards punting distance and pinning deep, while penalizing touchbacks, blocks and returns. Specifically, we recommend:
  
  - 1 point per punt with Net between 40 and 50 yards
  - 3 points per punt with Net between 50 and 60 yards
  - 6 points per punt with Net above 60 yards
  
  - 1 point per punt downed between the 20 and 10
  - 3 points per punt downed between the 10 and 5
  - 6 points per punt downed inside the 5.
  
  - \-1 point per touchback,
  - \-1 per blocked punt, and
  - \-1 per returned punt
  
And voilà\!

Most punts will be worth between 0 and 3 points, and the best
possible punt, with a 60+ yard net, downed inside the 5, gives a total of 13
points – the equivalent of a 60 yard receiving touchdown in most PPR
leagues.

## Section 2: Punter Fantasy Tiers But Only If You Use Our Scoring Don’t @ Us

### Tier 1a: Blue-chip talent

*Our scoring system rewards punters who hit on three of the following:
volume (aka defensive coaches or subpar offense), big leg, and pin-deep
ability (either on their own or with an elite coverage team). The two
following players are the Travis Kelces of punters. In 2020 they
averaged a full point more per game than any other punter, and there’s
no reason to think that trend should stop in 2021.*

|Rank |Punter             | 2020  ppg| 2020 Rank |
|:-    |:-----------------|:-----|:--|
|P1  |Jake Bailey           |  8.75|P1|
|P2  |Michael Dickson          |  8.25|P2|

### Tier 1b: Ol’ Reliables

*You can pretty much count on these guys to turn in a solid punting
performance, week in week out. Logan Cooke and Tress Way sit on the
border between the top two tiers; Brett Kern exemplifies the Ol’
Reliable moniker; Johnny Hekker has extreme boom potential, but lacked
consistency down the stretch (not to mention he might get you a few
points here and there off of fakes); and Matt Haack squeaks in due to
his pin-deep prowess.*

|Rank |Punter             | 2020  ppg| 2020 Rank |
|:-    |:-----------------|:---------|:------------|
|P3  |Logan Cooke          |    7.07 |P3|
|P4  |Tress Way            |   6.63|P6|
|P5  |Brett Kern            |    5.46|P10|
|P6  |Johnny Hekker            |    5.67|P8|
|P7  |Matt Haack           |   6.63|P5|

### Tier 2a: Younguns who we’re pretty sure we’ll be good again next season

*Any of these three may well perform better than some or all of the 1b
punters; however, they’re just a little too young and unproven for us to
group them all together. Jack Fox is definitely ranked too low, but with
just a 1-year sample, and a downward trending second half of 2020, we
have to wait before bumping him up. Wishnowsky has been good, but not at
the level of the vets above him, and Charlton had a solid rookie
campaign and gets a bump from playing on a team with major questions at
QB (sorry Sammy).*

|Rank |Punter             | 2020  ppg| 2020 Rank |
|:-    |:-----------------|:---------|:------------|
|P8  |Jack Fox            |    6.94 |P4|
|P9  |Mitch Wishnowsky            |   5.53|P9|
|P10  |Joseph Charlton            |    4.50|P16|

### Tier 2b: Low Risk, Moderate Reward

*These guys are a little past their primes, but have the stuff to never
be bad. Watch out for the potential camp battle between Huber and Ohio
State UDFA Drue Chrisman.*

|Rank |Punter             | 2020  ppg| 2020 Rank |
|:-    |:-----------------|:---------|:------------|
|P11  |Sam Koch            |    4.64 |P15|
|P12  |Andy Lee          |   3.68|P25|
|P13  |Kevin Huber            |    5.07|P13|

### Tier Of His Own: Bojo

*Coming off an excellent 2020 season, Bojórquez was cut by the
Bills in lieu of getting a raise. Bojo promptly signed with the Rams,
probably the team on which he has the least chance of ever being the
starter. All that said, if Bojo signs elsewhere, or somehow becomes the
starter for the Rams, snatch him up\!*

|Rank |Punter             | 2020  ppg| 2020 Rank |
|:-    |:-----------------|:---------|:------------|
|P14  |Corey Bojorquez            |    5.40 |P11|

### Tier 3: Low Risk, Low Reward

*3 consists of punters who have been in the league long enough to know
how to avoid a bad season, but have less upside than the 2b
guys. You should be able to pick these guys off the waiver wire. Dixon
is a name to watch here and a potential bounce-back candidate. Cam
Johnston may end up leading the league in punts pending what happens in
Houston. Tommy Townsend has little upside based on his tiny volume.*

|Rank |Punter             | 2020  ppg| 2020 Rank |
|:-    |:-----------------|:---------|:------------|
|P15  |Pat O'Donnell         |    4.50 |P15|
|P16  |Rigoberto Sanchez         |    3.53 |P15|
|P17  |Cam Johnston        |    4.69 |P15| 
|P18  |Riley Dixon         |    4.18 |P15|
|P19  |A.J. Cole III        |    4.31 |P15|
|P20  |Sam Martin      |    4.25 |P15|
|P21  |Michael Palardy        |    n/a |n/a|
|P22  |Tommy Townsend      |    4.44 |P15|
|P23  |Bradley Pinion     |    4.07 |P15|

### Tier R: Rookies

\*Given how we’ve consistently found that college stats aren’t
particularly predictive of pro performance, ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯ But stay tuned -
we’ll add rookie punters as we hear about training camp battles.\*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressley Harvin (P24 2020-NA)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other starting rookies TBA

### Deep Sleepers

*Chances are, one of these guys (let’s set the O/U at 1.5) will put up
some really nice numbers this season, but we won’t try to predict which
one. If you’re into that kind of team building, or one of these guys
plays for your team and you’re into that, do your worst\! Arryn Siposs
and Blake Gilikin have a shot to rise fast but we can’t project anything
given how little we know of them.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Braden Mann (P25 - 2020 1.93 PPG)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie Gillan (P26 - 2020 2.19 PPG)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryan Anger (P27 - 2020 3.88 PPG)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arryn Siposs (P32 - 2020: NA)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blake Gillikin (P33 - 2020: NA)

### Not currently on a team

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Morstead (P34 - 2020: 5.35 PPG)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris Jones (P35 - 2020:1.75PPG)

### Only if you’re in a 20 team league with two punter slots

*Ty Long scored a total of -8 points last season. 4 kickers scored more
punting fantasy points. That’s about all you need to know.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ty Long (P36 - 2020: -0.5PPG)
