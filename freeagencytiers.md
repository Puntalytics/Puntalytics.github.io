# 2023 Free Agency Team Tiers

## Tier 1: absolute punting chaos

- Arizona Cardinals
- New England Patriots
- LA Chargers (**The Chargers re-signed punter JK Scott on a 2 year, $4M deal. It's not what we might have done; let the chaos reign forever, amen**)

The following teams have no punter on their books yet, and for whatever reason (he retired @ the cardinals, weird stuff @ the patriots, or it’s the Chargers @ the chargers), it doesn’t seem like their 2022 punter will be back. Post Jake Bailey release, the Patriots now become the likeliest team to draft a punter in April, so far it doesn’t look like an outstanding class, but we’ll get to that later.



## Tier 2: mild punting chaos

- Atlanta Falcons (**The Falcons reportedly agreed to terms with punter Bradley Pinion, chaos defered another year**)
- Buffalo Bills (**The Bills reportedly agreed to a 3 year $7.5M with punter Sam Martin, chaos eliminated**)
- LA Rams
- NY Giants (**The Giants reportedly agreed to terms with punter Jamie Gillan, eliminating the potential chaos**)
- Denver Broncos (**The Broncos re-signed punter Corliss Waitmain, bye bye chaos**)
- Miami Dolphins (**The Dolphins agreed to terms with former Patriots' punter, Jake Bailey**)

The following teams have no punter on their books, but it should only be a matter of time before they re-sign their guy. None of these are a lock though, so it wouldn’t be shocking to see these teams shop around for better or cheaper options.


## Tier 3: about to resign their star

- Kansas City Chiefs (**The Chiefs tendered Tommy Townsend, but he could still accept an external offer sheet**)
- New Orleans Saints (**The Saints extended their punter Blake Gillikin, locking him in as their post-Morstead era guy**)

Both teams here have gotten solid to elite performances out of their rookie punters. The Chiefs’ Tommy Townsend is an RFA and the Saints’ Blake Gillikin is an ERFA. It’s hard to see any other outcome than they eventually get paid top dollar by their current teams

## Tier 4: The Cincinnati Bengals

- Cincinnati Bengals

Drue Chrisman might be good! But it’s too early to tell. He should be their primary option going into the season

## Tier 5: it’s broke (it might not be broke but it’s definitely not elite) and you could fix it

- Philadelphia Eagles
- Pittsburgh Steelers
- New York Jets (**The Jets pulled the trigger and signed former Saints, Dolphins, Falcons, and Jets legend Thomas Morstead**)

These teams have young and underachieving punters entering the last year of their deals. We cautioned them all to look for competition last year, but they did not heed our advice. They definitely should take a good look at the UDFA pool this year.

## Tier 6: No reason to shake things up

- Houston Texans
- Indianapolis Colts
- Green Bay Packers
- Cleveland Browns

Solid to good vets on the last years of their deals. These four teams will be interesting next year. It remains to be seen how Colts’ punter Rigoberto Sanchez will come back from a torn achilles during training camp in 2022.


## Tier 7: year of the punter winner

- Tampa Bay Bucs
- Tennessee Titans
- Baltimore Ravens
- Chicago Bears
- Minnesota Vikings

These teams played the punter lottery in the right year and now get 2-3 more cheap years with their promising (or already stud) young punters. Despite his worse than expected numbers last year, we still believe Ravens punter Jordan Stout will make a good pro.

## Tier 8: Locked in with their guy

- Carolina Panthers
- Dallas Cowboys
- Detroit Lions
- Jacksonville Jags
- Las Vegas Raiders
- ~~NE Patriots: weird sitch because Bailey was bad and then also suspended (?) but the contract makes him not feasible to move on from~~
- San Francisco 49ers
- Seattle Seahawks
- Washington Commanders

Pretty self-explanatory.
