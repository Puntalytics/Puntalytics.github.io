# puntr

We've been compiling our code for importing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing punting data into an R package, `puntr`. 
This is mostly for our own ease of use, but it's also available on github for anyone interested.  
  
Install via:
```R
devtools::install_github("Puntalytics/puntr")
library(puntr)
```
You can also find a .rds file of all punts from the 2000-2019 seasons at Puntalytics/Puntalytics/data/punts_all_seasons.rds
